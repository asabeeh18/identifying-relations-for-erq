	[[Image:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|right |thumb|310px| '''Decatur, Alabama''' (<small>top center</small>), along the [[Tennessee River]], is southwest of [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] and north of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], along [[Interstate 65]].  Nearby towns include: [[Madison, AL|Madison]], [[Hartselle, AL|Hartselle]] and [[Athens, Alabama]].]]		'''Decatur''' is a city in [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone]] and [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan]] Counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. The city, known as "The River City", is located in [[North Alabama|Northern Alabama]] on the banks of [[Wheeler Lake]], along the [[Tennessee River]].  It is the largest city and county seat of Morgan County.{{GR|6}}  The estimated population in 2006 was 55,778.<ref name=popest/> 		Decatur is also the core city of the two-county large [[Decatur Metropolitan Area]] which had 149,269 in 2006.  Combined with the Huntsville Metropolitan Area, the two create the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], of which, Decatur is the second largest city.		Like many southern cities in the early 1800s, Decatur's early success was based upon its location along a river.  Railroad routes and boating traffic pushed the city to the front of [[North Alabama]]'s  economic atmosphere.  The city rapidly grew into a large economic center within the [[Tennessee Valley]] and was a hub for travelers and cargo between [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]/[[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]/[[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].  Throughout the 20th century, the city experienced steady growth, but was eclipsed as the regional economic center by a fast growing Huntsville during the space race.  The city now finds its economy heavily based on manufacturing industries, cargo transit, and hi-tech industries such as  [[General Electric]], and the [[United Launch Alliance]]. 		==History==	Initially the area was known as Rhodes Ferry, named after a ferry that crossed the [[Tennessee River]] in the 1810s at the present-day location of Rhodes Ferry Park. The city was incorporated as Albany in the year 1821. It was named in honor of [[Stephen Decatur]]; after he was killed in a duel in 1820, President Monroe directed that the Alabama town be named for him.		Decatur was a very important point in [[North Alabama]] during its earliest days.  Decatur was the eastern terminus of the [[Decatur-Courtland-Tuscumbia Railroad]] (in the late 1820s and early 1830s), the first railway built west of the Appalachian Mountains.  		Because of its location on the strategic [[Memphis & Charleston Railroad]], Decatur was the site of several encounters during the [[American Civil War]]. All but three buildings were burned down during the 1864 [[Battle of Decatur]], when Decatur was referred to as ''A Tough Nut To Crack''. The three that remained are the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], Dancy-Polk House, and the [[Rhea-McEntire House]]. 		While the city was under Confederate control, plans for the [[Battle of Shiloh]] were mapped out within the Rhea-McEntire House.  These activities made the house one of the most historic buildings in Decatur.		New Decatur was a city that rose out of the ashes of former Decatur west of the railroad tracks.  New Decatur was founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1889 across the tracks from Albany.  In the early 1900s the two cities melded to form one City of Decatur.  There is a noticeable difference between the two sides of town.  The cities developed differently at different times, and still to this day have  somewhat different cultures.  Eastern portions of Decatur tend to act more suburban and traditional, while western portions tend to look more metropolitan and contemporary.		The [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]], on the edge of downtown, is the oldest bank building in the State of [[Alabama]], at 173 years old.  The first wave pool in the [[United States]] was built here and is still in operation at the [[Point Mallard Aquatic Center]].  Decatur has the largest [[Victorian era]] home district in the state of Alabama.  Decatur is also home to Alabama's oldest opera house, the ([[Cotaco Opera House]]), which still stands on Johnston Street.		In the past its industries included repair shops of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], car works, engine works, tannery, bottling plants, and manufacturers of lumber, sashes and blinds, fertilizers, cigars, flour, cottonseed oil, and various other products.		===Historical Timeline===	*Area founded as Rhodes Ferry in 1810s.	*Rhodes Ferry incorporated as Albany in 1821.	*Dancy-Polk House erected in 1829.	*Also in 1829-1830, Decatur became the home to the first railroad ever built west of the Appalachian Mountains [[Tuscumbia-Courtland-Decatur Railroad]].	*[[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] erected on [[July 29]], [[1833]].	*[[Rhea-McEntire House]] built in 1836.	*[[Battle of Decatur]] takes place during the [[American Civil War]] in November, 1864.	*Decatur's [[Victorian Era]] Home District built between 1870 and 1910	*New Decatur founded in 1887, incorporated in 1889.	*[[Princess Theatre, Decatur|Princess Theatre]] built in 1919.	*Albany Decatur, and New Decatur merge in 1927.	*President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] dedicates [[Delano Park (Decatur)|Delano Park]] in 1930s.	*[[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]] brings new business to Decatur through the military, and energy management in the 1930s.		==Geography==	The [[Tennessee River]] has traditionally been the northern border of the city and Morgan County, while Flint Creek and the Wheeler Wildlife Refuge on the east side of the city.  The city does extend to the other side of Flint Creek and the Refuge in the Indian Hills and Burningtree subdivision areas.  There is also an inlet that extends one mile (1.6 km) into the city limits from [[Wheeler Lake]] called Dry Branch.   There is also a small portion of Decatur that extends into Limestone County north along the Highway 31 coridor to the Calhoun College area and along Hwy 20 Coridor until it reaches I-65.   		The northern portion of Decatur sits on top of a short hill that overlooks the Tennessee River, this creates a very steep dropoff to the river shore a Rhodes Ferry Park.  This hill allows the [[Captain William J. Hudson "Steamboat Bill" Memorial Bridge|"Steamboat Bill" Memorial Bridge]] to leave the mainland at grade without any major sloping required more height to cross the river while not interfering with Decatur's heavy barge traffic.  This hill extends from the banks of the river about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} south to the 14th St./Magnolia St. intersection with 6th Avenue ([[US 31]]).		South past the 14th St. and 6th Ave. intersection, land continues to remain flat.  South, and also west, past [[State Route 67 (Alabama)|Alabama 67]] there are a few minor mountains that sit within the city limits.  		Decatur is located at {{coor dms|34|34|52|N|86|59|0|W|city}} (34.580992, -86.983392){{GR|1}}.		According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 59.9&nbsp;square miles (155.1&nbsp;km²), of which, 53.4&nbsp;square miles (138.3&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 6.5&nbsp;square miles (16.8&nbsp;km²) of it (10.83%) is water.		===Climate===	Decatur experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]], with hot, humid summers and a generally mild winter.  Temperatures range from 89 °F (31.6 C) in the summer to 49.0 °F (9.4 C) during winter. The city rarely experiences [[tornado]]es during the spring and fall.  But, significant severe weather does occur from time to time in the active seasons.  The most significant tornado event included the [[Super Outbreak]] in 1974, while the city was largely unaffected by the more recent [[Huntsville, Alabama Tornado]] in 1989 that killed 21 and injured almost 500.  [[Hurricanes]] are rare since Decatur sits nearly {{convert|300|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  Though a few tropical systems do track through the central [[Tennessee Valley]], they rarely inflict much damage on the city. Winters usually do not produce much snow; a large amount of snow is rare within the city limits. A small, measurable amount of snow can be experienced a few times each year.		===Bodies of water===		*'''[[Wheeler Lake]]'''	*'''[[Tennessee River]]'''	*'''[[Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge]]'''	*'''[[Flint Creek]]'''		===Nearby suburbs===		*[[Moulton Heights, Alabama|Moulton Heights]]	*[[Priceville, Alabama|Priceville]]	*[[Trinity, Alabama|Trinity]]	*[[Somerville, Alabama|Somerville]]	*[[Danville, Alabama|Danville]]	*[[Tanner, Alabama|Tanner]]	*[[Burningtree Mountain, Alabama|Burningtree Mountain]]	*Caddo	*Hartselle		===Neighboring cities/towns===		*[[Athens, Alabama|Athens]] (north) - Limestone County	*[[Hartselle, Alabama|Hartselle]] (south) - Morgan County	*[[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] (northeast) - Limestone/Madison County	*[[Priceville, Alabama|Priceville]] (east) - Morgan County	*[[Mooresville, Alabama|Mooresville]] (northeast) - Limestone County	*[[Trinity, Alabama|Trinity]] (northwest) - Morgan County		===Neighborhoods===		'''Decatur''' is, unofficially, divided into four different regions of town (''Northeast'', ''Southeast'', ''Northwest'', ''Southwest'').  The reason for the existence of these four regions is because of [[The Beltline (Decatur)|The Beltline]].  ''Southeast'' and ''Northeast'' Decatur already existed as parts of town, but were simply thought of as one, as there was a much lower population at that time in the ''West''.  ''Southwest'' consists mostly of the area bordered by 6th Avenue ([[US 31]]), 8th Street W, and Danville Road.  ''Northwest'' is bordered by Danville Road, Central Parkway, and 14th Street W.  		Two halves of town were successfully created in the years following the completion of ''The Beltline'' as a bypass.  While there are few major cultural differences between the ''East'' and the ''West'', minute differences such as street grid patterns, zoning patterns, and architectural styles are noticeable.

The [[Port of Decatur]] sees large amounts of barge traffic from up and down the Tennessee River, which has led to twenty [[Fortune 500]] companies opening plants in the city.		Decatur is also known as the "Home of [[Meow Mix]]", after the company bought a {{convert|200000|sqft|sqm|sing=on}} facility in town, and now utilizes its riverfront property to ship the finished product up and down the Tennessee River.		Being part of the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area|Huntsville-Decatur CSA]], the city lies within the region having the most engineers per person in the nation.  		A recent BRAC Base realignment will bring a population, conservatively estimated at 5,000&ndash;10,000 people (not including their families), to the area surrounding [[Redstone Arsenal]].

With visiting populations rising into 75,000, people crowd around numerous seven-story tall inflating balloons.  Because of the Alabama Jubilee, Decatur has been named "The Ballooning Capital of [[Alabama]]" by the Alabama State Legislature.		The [[Spirit of America Festival]] is one of the largest free [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] festivals in the south.  More than 65,000 people arrive in Decatur to watch annual celebrations and the Miss Point Mallard Beauty Pageant.		[[Riverfest]] is a celebration sponsored by the Decatur [[Jaycees]].  Set at [[Rhodes Ferry Park]], along the beautiful [[Tennessee River]], barbecuers come from all over the country to try their luck at beating [[Big Bob Gibson's]] Barbecue, the seven-time world champion winner.		Another big celebration in Decatur and [[North Alabama]], the [[Racking Horse World Celebration]], attracts numerous horses from around the world to compete in the largest racking horse competition.

It has an average daily circulation of 20,824 and a Sunday circulation of 23,840.  The paper circulates in the morning to an area that includes [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]], [[Lawrence County, Alabama|Lawrence County]], [[Cullman County, Alabama|Cullman County]], and southern portions of [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone]].		[http://www.al.com/huntsvilletimes ''The Huntsville Times''] is the only other newspaper with a larger circulation in the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], and has been in circulation since 1996 to most area counties, when the ''Huntsville News'' closed. Before then, the ''News'' was the morning paper, and the ''Times'' was the afternoon paper. After the ''News'' closed, the ''Times'' remained an afternoon paper until 2004.		==Transportation==	===Air Transport===		Decatur is served by two major airports.  The [[Huntsville International Airport]], in suburban [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] is the second busiest airport in Alabama, behind [[Birmingham International Airport]].  The city is also served by the busiest regional airport in Alabama, the [[Pryor Field Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/061001/hub.shtml | title = Rivers, rails, roads, and air | date = 2006-10-01 | publisher = Decatur Daily Newspaper}}</ref>		===Roadways===		[[Image:STMBTBLBridge.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Captain William J. Hudson "Steamboat Bill" Memorial Bridges]]]] 	Decatur, being only a mid-sized city, has not yet seen the conveniences of a major controlled access highway passing through the city limits.		Decatur's main thoroughfares are 6th Avenue ([[US 31]]) and [[The Beltline (Decatur)|The Beltline]] ([[State Route 67 (Alabama)|State Route 67]]).  6th Avenue begins as both Alabama 20, [[Alternate U.S. 72]], and US 31 split after being carried by the twin-span [["Steamboat Bill" Hudson Memorial Bridge]] that crosses [[Tennessee River]] at the north central part of town.  Alabama 20/Alternate U.S. 72 continues west towards [[The Shoals]], after the Beltline begins in the vicinity of the [[Solutia]] plant.  6th Avenue continues southward where it eventually intersects with Beltline Road.  After that intersection, 6th Avenue continues southward to Birmingham as Decatur Highway.		[[The Beltline (Decatur)|The Beltline]] was built as a western bypass to relieve congestion on 6th Avenue.  In doing so, however, this created another problem as sprawl quickly developed along the new arterial.  Construction is currently under way to widen the road from four to six lanes with the project expected to be completed by 2010.		===Major Highways===		*[[Image:I-65.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 65]]	*[[Image:I-565.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 565]]	*[[Image:US 31.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 31]]	*[[Image:Alternate plate.svg|20px]]<br>[[Image:US 72.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 72 Alternate]]	*[[Image:Alabama 20.svg|20px]] [[State Route 20 (Alabama)|Alabama 20]]	*[[Image:Alabama 24.svg|20px]] [[State Route 24 (Alabama)|Alabama 24]]	*[[Image:Alabama 67.svg|20px]] [[State Route 67 (Alabama)|Alabama 67]]		===Busiest Intersections===		{| class="wikitable"	|-	!

In addition, there are plans to transform Alabama Highway 20/Alternate US 72 into an extension of [[Interstate 565]] into the city.  Governor [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] has said  he will make sure that plans for the road will be put on the fast track, since more than 85 vehicle accidents occur on Highway 20's final approach into Decatur each year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050613/roads.shtml| title = 3-year transit plan | date = 06-05-2005 | publisher = Decatur Daily Newspaper }}</ref>		== Education ==	The [[Decatur City Schools|Decatur City School System]] is well regarded throughout the nation.  Both of the city's high schools (Decatur High School and Austin High School) have been awarded the ''Safe Schools Award'' for the past two years that it has been presented in the State of Alabama.  The two schools are the only ones in the state to have won this award both years.  With the addition of the International Baccalaureate Program to Austin and Decatur High Schools, Decatur has become the first Alabama school system north of Birmingham and one of five in the state to offer the honors program for juniors and seniors (as of July 2006).		All high school football and soccer teams compete in the 9,000 seat [[Ogle Stadium]].  Indoor track meets are held at the 10,000 seat [[Racking Horse World Celebration Arena]].		However, both Austin and Decatur failed to make adequate yearly progress in 2006 as mandated in the No Child Left Behind Act.  The state said Austin's 86 percent graduation rate was four points too low. 		Decatur High missed in two categories: percent of special education students the system tested in reading and percent tested in math. The graduate rate was 76 percent. However, the graduation rate is unreliable since students who move to different schools are considered "dropouts" and this drastically distorts the figures of how many students actually graduate.		The only institution of higher education located within the Decatur city limits is [http://www.calhoun.cc.al.us/ Calhoun Community College].  It has three campuses; the main campus is located just north of the city on Highway 31.		===Local Elementary and Middle Schools===		'''High Schools'''		*[[Austin High School (Decatur, Alabama)|Austin High School]] (IB Diploma Program)	*[[Decatur High School (Alabama)|Decatur High School]] (IB Diploma Program)		'''Middle Schools'''		*[[Brookhaven Middle School]]	*[[Cedar Ridge Middle School]]	*[[Oak Park Middle School]]		'''Elementary Schools'''		*[[Austinville Elementary School]]	*[[Banks-Caddell Elementary School]]	*[[Benjamin Davis Elementary School]] (Magnet/IB Primary Years)	*[[Chestnut Grove Elementary School]]	*[[Eastwood Elementary School]]	*[[Frances Nungester Elementary School]]	*[[Julian Harris Elementary School]]	*[[Leon Sheffield Elementary School]] (Magnet/IB Primary Years)	*[[Somerville Road Elementary School]]	*[[Walter Jackson Elementary School]]	*[[West Decatur Elementary School]]	*[[Woodmeade Elementary School]]		'''Private Schools'''		*[[Decatur Heritage Christian Academy]]	*[[Cornerstone Christian Academy (Decatur, Alabama)|Cornerstone Christian Academy]]	*[[Faith Christian Academy K-12 SACS & ACSI]] [[http://faithacademy.org] [[http://sacs.org]	*[[St. Ann's Catholic School]]	*[[Tennessee Valley Christian School]]		'''Local Higher Education'''		*[[Athens State University]]	*[[Calhoun Community College|Calhoun Community College System]]	**[[Calhoun Community College at Decatur|Calhoun Decatur Campus]]	**[[Calhoun Community College at Redstone Arsenal|Calhoun Redstone Arsenal Campus]]	**[[Calhoun Community College at Cummings Research Park|Calhoun Huntsville/Cummings Research Park Campus]]	*[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]]		==Nicknames==	*'''"A Grand City on a Charming Scale"''' - The official Decatur City tag line adopted in 2005.	*'''The River City''' - So named because of the Tennessee River that flows on the northern edge of town and that inspires festivals and culture in the city.	*'''The Chicago of the South''' - Given to Decatur in the 1880s by a company formed to create a planned community, "New Decatur," just south of the original Decatur.
