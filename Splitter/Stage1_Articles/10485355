It features their first 13 singles, EPs and split records on one CD.		Since Melt-Banana's very first release was a 7" EP called Hedgehog they refer to all their minor releases (singles, EPs and splits) as hedgehogs. This contains the first 13, and so far they have released 23 "hedgehogs".		==Track listing==	# "Stick Out" – 0:48	# "So Unfilial Rule" – 0:14	# "Mind Thief" – 1:44	# "Screw, Loose" – 0:23	# "Scrubber" – 0:16	# "Pierced Eye" – 2:11	# "Ketchup-Mess" – 1:16	# "First Defy" – 0:10	# "Iguana in Trouble" – 1:26	# "It's in the Pillcase" – 1:17	# "Rush & Warp" – 1:04	# "Picnic in Panic" – 2:00	# "Buddhism Core" – 0:55	# "Hangnail (Let It Go)" – 0:39	# "No One Wants Next One" – 0:38	# "Sicklist on Fire" – 1:06	# "One Dimensional" – 0:20	# "Not D, But M, Also S" – 0:43	# "Mind Thief [live]" – 1:35	# "P-Pop-Slop [live]" – 1:29	# "Making Fuss, Fuss, Fuss" – 0:37	# "Turtle vs. Bunny (Who One?)" – 0:56	# "Pig to Dog" – 0:19	# "Bird-Like Monkey in Cave, Singing in Drops" – 2:06	# "Bad Gut Missed Fist" – 1:09	# "It's Not My Fault" – 0:22	# "Neck on Me" – 0:26	# "Stop the Cook-Cu Test" – 0:25	# "No Doubt" – 1:03	# "Scooped Brain in a Cup" – 1:02	# "Capital 1060" – 0:53	# "How to Parlare" – 0:27	# "I Say, 'Shoot!'" – 0:40	# "Minus-Minus-To One" – 0:23	# "Call Me Please-6824" – 0:22	# "Popsy Teeth in Red" – 0:19	# "Blackout Screen" – 1:56	# "To Be Continued?" – 0:24	# "$10 a Pile [Ax version]" – 2:00	# "Disposable Weathercock [Helpful 80 Points version]" – 4:05	# "Y-Axis" – 0:29	# "Aquatic Bee" – 1:51	# "Wedge!" – 1:57	# "Seesaw Semiology" – 0:59	# "Cough, Coughed, Coughing" – 0:54	# "Q For Quinine" – 1:00	# "Bird-Like-Monkey, Pt. 2" – 0:07	# "Least Clipper" – 1:47	# "Baby Buggy Spitted" – 1:18	# "Drill the Dentist" – 0:39	# "Last Finger Split" – 1:47	# "West the Fist (Just For Reflection)" – 4:04	# "Dead Spex" – 1:01	# "Sonic Brain Burst" – 1:11	# "Ether Twisted" – 1:11	# "Shoot the Moon" – 0:58		==Track info==	* Tracks 1-6 from Hedgehog 7" EP (Charnel Music, 1994)	* Tracks 7-9 from split 7" EP w/ God is My Co-Pilot (HG Fact, 1994)	* Tracks 10-12 from It's In the Pillcase 7" EP ([[Skin Graft Records]], 1995)	* Tracks 13-18 from split 7" EP w/ [[Discordance Axis]] (HG Fact, 1995)	* Tracks 19-20 from split 7" EP w/ Pencilneck (Anti-Music, 1995)	* Tracks 21-24 from split 7" EP w/ Target Shoppers (Destroy All Music and Betley Welcome Careful Driver, 1996)	* Tracks 25-38 from split 10" EP w/ [[Stilluppsteypa]] (Fire inc./Something Weird, 1996)	* Tracks 39-40 from untitled (Piano One) 7" EP (Gentle Giant, 1996)	* Tracks 41-42 from split 7" EP w/ Plainfield (Smelly Records, 1997)	* Tracks 43-50 from Eleventh 7" EP (Slap a Ham Records, 1997)	* Track 51 from split 5" EP w/ Xerobot (Coat-Tail, 1998)	* Track 52 from split 7" EP w/ Killout Trash (Kool Pop Recordings/Rodel Records, 1998)	* Tracks 53-56 from Dead Spex 7" EP (HG Fact, 1998)		[[Category:Melt-Banana albums]]	[[Category:2005 albums]]		{{2000s-album-stub}}
