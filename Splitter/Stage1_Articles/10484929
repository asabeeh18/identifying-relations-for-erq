The album is not a conventional "live" album: it was not recorded at a concert, but live in the studio specially for John Zorn's [[Tzadik Records]] during the band's 1998 US tour. Many of the songs are being played in slightly different arrangements than the album versions. It is kind of a "best-of" release but with all the material re-recorded live in the studio. It also features their cover of [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Surfin' USA]]".		The album features an untitled hidden track just a few seconds after "Plot in a Pot". This is a noisy instrumental jam with someone announcing all of Melt-Banana's tour dates. The album begins in a similar way: before "Scratch Or Stitch", the same person says: "Yea looks like we're ready to go, yep here they come... yep here we go!"		The photos and artwork were made by [[Ikue Mori]].		==Track listing==	#"Scratch or Stitch" – 1:34	#"Rragg" – 0:54	#"Wedge" – 1:08	#"Seesaw Semiology" – 1:14	#"Circle-Jerk (Chase the Magic Words, Lego Lego)" – 2:11	#"Sick Zip Everywhere" – 1:48	#"Disposable Weathercock" – 1:49	#"Mind Thief" – 1:36	#"Blandished Hatman" – 1:06	#"Iguana in Trouble" – 2:04	#"Tapir's Flown Away" – 2:48	#"His Name Is Mickey (At Least She Got Him...)" – 0:39	#"We Love Choco-Pa!" – 0:18	#"Some Kind of Id" – 0:14	#"Stick Out" – 0:39	#"Scrubber" – 0:22	#"Screw, Loose" – 0:09	#"First Defy" – 0:11	#"So Unfilial Rule" – 0:09	#"Spathic!" – 2:42	#"Picnic in Panic" – 2:11	#"It's in the Pillcase" – 2:21	#"Surfin' U.S.A." – 2:34	#"Bad Gut Missed First" – 1:42	#"Ketchup-Mess" – 1:24	#"Plot in a Pot" – 5:19			{{1990s-alt-rock-album-stub}}		[[Category:1998 albums]]	[[Category:Live albums]]	[[Category:Melt-Banana albums]]	[[Category:Tzadik Records albums]]
