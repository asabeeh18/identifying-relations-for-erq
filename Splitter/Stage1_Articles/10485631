'''Bruce J. Tromberg''' is an American photochemist. He is Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the  College of Medicine, [[University of California, Irvine]] and at the [[The Henry Samueli School of Engineering]] at Irvine. He is also the Director of the [[Beckman Laser Institute]] and Medical Clinic at Irvine. 		==Education and specialty==	Tromberg received a B.A., in Chemistry from  [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1979, and a M.S.(1983) and Ph.D.(1988) in Chemistry at the [[University of Tennessee]], working at  [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]		He is a specialist in the area of the interaction of laser radiation and tissue, and particularly in using diagnostic techniques including optical tomography and other methods such as photon migration--a technique of which he is the developed-- to analyze the effects of laser energy on tissue.  He has also worked more generally in  the  field of biomedical optics including tissue optical spectroscopy, frequency-domain photon migration, non-linear microscopy, and photodynamic therapy.		==Career==	Tromberg has chaired several OSA meetings on biomedical optics and served as a member of several NIH panels on imaging related topics. He has been a guest editor of both OSA and Lasers in Medicine and Surgery journals and has also been on the advisory council on optical technologies for the US Public Health Service. 	 	Tromberg is serving a two year term on the SPIE Board of Directors that will be completed at the end of this year. He has been a member of the SPIE Publications Committee for a number of years and is currently editor-in-chief of SPIE's [[Journal of Biomedical Optics]] 		He has supervised the research of over 19 postdoctoral fellows, and of 9 Ph.D. students.		==Publications==	His publications include 40 peer-reviewed papers, 115 conference papers, 14 book chapters, and 10 patents.
