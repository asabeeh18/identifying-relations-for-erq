{{Cleanup|date=January 2007}}		'''Ip Chun''' (葉準 or '''Yip Jun''') (b. [[1924]]) is [[Yip Man]]'s (Yip Gei-Man) eldest son.  	He was born in 1924 in Foshan in the Zheyieng Delta region of the Guangdong province of Southern China. He began studying Wing Chun with his father when he was 7 years old, however he admits that he did not really want to learn at that time and that he remembers relatively little from that early tuition.		When the communist revolution swept through China in 1949, the communists began to persecute the wealthy, the influential and anyone connected to the Kuomintang (the political party founded by Sun Yat-Sen, the first president of the Republic of China). Since Ip Man was both wealthy and a Captain of Local Police patrols of Namhoi, he felt forced to leave China, finally settling in Hong Kong after a short stay in Macao with friends. However, being only 24, Ip Chun stayed behind to continue his studies at University studying Chinese history and traditional Chinese music. He also researched Chinese Philosophy		.		==Lineage==	{| border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0	| colspan="2" align="center" | Lineage in Wing Chun 	|-	|[[sifu]]||his father [[Yip Man]] (葉問) 	|-	| colspan="2" align="center"  | &nbsp;<br>'''Ip Chun''' (葉準)<br>&nbsp; 	|-	|students|| Numerous including: <br>	[[Michael Tse]] web site:[http://www.qimagazine.com/main.html Tse Qigong Centre]	<br>		[[Shaun Rawcliffe]] web site:[http://www.wingchun.co.uk/ Midlands Wing Chun Kuen (UK)]	<br>	Colin Ward web site:[http://www.wingchunkwoon.net/  Northern Wing Chun Kung Fu Association (UK)]	<br>	http://www.ipchun.org  The Official web site for certified representatives of Grandmaster Ip Chun.	<br>		Terrence Yip web site: [http://www.yipwingchun.com/  Sifu Yip Pui]	<br> 	[[Samuel Kwok]] web site: [http://www.qimagazine.com/main.html Kwokwingchun.com]	|}		==External links==	* [http://www.ipchun.org/ his website]	* [http://www.ipchun.net/ his students association website]	* [http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/theoutsiders2005/20051021.html  A TV programme of RTHK that interviewed Peter, a Swedish and one of his students]		{{DEFAULTSORT:Ip, Chun}}		[[Category:1924 births]]	[[Category:Living people]]	[[Category:Wing Chun practitioners from Hong Kong]]
