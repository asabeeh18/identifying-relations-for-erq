'''Simba''' is a popular potato chip manufacturer and has been producing its products in [[South Africa]] since 1956, when it was established by the Greyvenstein family[http://www.simba.co.za/Brands/frame_simba.htm]		Having successfully marketed [[Ouma's Rusks]] in the 1940s and 1950s, by 1955 the Greyvenstein family were looking for ways to diversify their family business. In that year, Leon Greyvenstein travelled to a food fair in [[Germany]] in search of ideas and met a man called Herman Lay â€“ the co-founder of [[Frito-Lay]], the largest chip company in the world. The two men struck up a friendship, and Leon travelled on to the [[USA]] where he saw a potato chip factory in action.		==Products==	*Ghost Pops	*Nik Naks		{{food-company-stub}}	{{SouthAfrica-stub}}		[[Category:Food companies of South Africa]]
