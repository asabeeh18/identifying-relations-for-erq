1048523, Kleinbahn_Haspe-Voerde-Breckerfeld
The '''Kleinbahn Haspe-Voerde-Breckerfeld''' was a [[narrow-gauge railway]] linking the cities of [[Breckerfeld]] and [[Ennepetal|Voerde]] with [[Haspe]] to the [[bergisch-märkischen Eisenbahn]].  Construction lasted from [[1901]] to [[1906]]. The original owners were:		*The country of [[Prussia]]	*[[Provinzialverband Westphalia]]	*[[Voerde]], formerly a municipality; now belongs to [[Ennepetal]]		This narrow-gauge railway is 18.39 km (11.43 mi) long and runs 2.4 km (1.5 mi) over publicly owned roads.  The majority of the span is sub-graded.  Major areas of the track are used by [[boxcar]]s in the valleys of [[Hasperbach]]es and [[Breckerfelder Hochfläche]].  For this purpose, a standard gauge is used.  The rail passes over the [[Hasper Talsperre|Hasper Dam]].  One of the trains is now in display in a museum railway in [[Switzerland]] ([http://malletlok.de/ge/ge_ch/bc105.htm]).		After [[World War I]], the company went into financial crisis and had to adjust its passenger load in [[1921]] due to an economic downturn.		To avoid bankruptcy, the company was bought in [[1927]] by [[Hagener Straßenbahn AG]] in [[Hagen]], and the city of Hagen expanded service at that time.  The railroad then became electrified, using 1100 [[volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]].		==External links==		(in German)		*[http://www.route-industriekultur.de/routen/09/09_24.html Industrial route in Ruhrgebiet 9]	*[http://www.route-industriekultur.de/routen/15/15_10.htm Route of Ruhrgebiet 15]	<!-- The following URL is not valid and I could not determine what it should be; if anyone can fix it, please do!  *[http://www.kleinbahn en.de/html/kleinbahn_hvb.html Rail map of Kleinbahn Haspe-Voerde-Breckerfeld] -->	*[http://www.bergisches-staedtedreieck.de/bergische_museumsbahn/fahrzeuge/fahrzeug_337.html Photo of a street car in Hagen]	*[http://www.route-industriekultur.de/routen/09/09_25.htm Excursion: The Hasper Dam]		{{coor title dms|51|18|02|N|7|24|18|E|region:DE-NW_type:city}}		[[Category:Railway lines]]	[[Category:North Rhine-Westphalia]]		[[de:Kleinbahn Haspe-Voerde-Breckerfeld]]
