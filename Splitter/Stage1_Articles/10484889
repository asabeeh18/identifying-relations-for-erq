I can't remember why I Prod'ed it rather than Speedying it, but an IP removed the Prod and added a blog reference attempting to assert notability. This is a team well below the top flight in its country, so there's no notability in the offing.

I'm intrigued to read, though, that ''The team is significant because it is said that the best soccer players in Annandale have joined the team'' and ''The members of the team are composed primarily of members of the Annandale High School band department'' - is Annandale a unique concentration of teens who are combined soccer/music geniuses....?
