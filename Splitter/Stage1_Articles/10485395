It is now a predominantly industrial area.		==History==	The peninsula was formed from [[clay]] deposits, which served as the left-bank of the Pochaina River. Rybalskyi Peninsula takes its name from the [[fishing industry]] which once existed on it. In 1897-1899, the peninsula was raised and strengthened, which would later enable it to house a [[shipyard]], as well as to form the Kiev Harbour between the peninsula and the [[Podil]] riverbank.		In 1926-1930, an electrical power station was constructed in the north-western part of the peninsula (engineered by B. Domanseho and M. Parusnykovyi). In the end of the 1930s, the [[Leninska Kuznya|Leninska Kuznia]] [[shipbuilding]] factory was reconstructed.		During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], the peninsula suffered heavy damage from bombings. After the war, reconstruction began and new factories and foundations were constructed.		==Present infrastructure==	In 1961, a new river port was built in the Harbour, and in 1963 the [[Bridges in Kiev#Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] was constructed to provide road access to the Rybalskyi Peninsula from the center of the city.		The main compound of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine|SZR]], the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, is located on the Rybalskyi Peninsula.		==Development plans==	[[Image:Kiev.
