Wales was famous for its [[coal mining]] in the [[Rhondda Valley]], the [[South Wales Valleys]] and throughout the [[South Wales coalfield]] and by 1913 the [[capital city]] of [[Cardiff]] had become the largest coal exporting port in the world, as coal was transported down by rail. [[Tower Colliery]] near [[Hirwaun]] is regarded by many as the oldest open coal mine and one of the largest in the world.		==History==	===Coal mining===	There is evidence of mining in the [[Blaenafon]] area going back to the [[14th century]], and there is evidence of mine workings at [[Mostyn Colliery|Mostyn]] as far back as 1261,<ref>'''The History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell'''; Thomas Pennant, 1796, p.133</ref> but it is believed to have been practised even as early as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. The coal mining industry burgeoned throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]] and into the [[19th century]], when shafts were sunk to complement the [[open-cast mining]] and [[drift mining]] already exploiting the ample and obvious coal resources.		During the first half of the nineteenth century mining was often at the centre of working-class discontent in [[Wales]], and a number of uprisings such as the [[Merthyr Rising]] in [[1831]] against employers were a characteristic of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Wales, [[Dic Penderyn]] became a martyr to industrial workers. The [[Chartist]] movement and the [[1839]] [[Newport Rising]] showed the growing concerns and awareness of the work force of their value to the nation. Although the Mines Act of 1842 was meant to prevent women and boys under 10 years of age from working underground, it is believed to have been widely ignored. Much later, in the middle of the [[20th century]], mining was still a hazardous enterprise, resulting in many accidents and long term ill-health with many of Blaenavon's older citizens still suffering from [[silicosis]] and other mining related diseases.		Incorporating the existing Coity colliery and Kearsley's pit (sunk in 1860), the [[Big Pit National Coal Museum|Big Pit]] ('Pwll Mawr' in the [[Welsh language]]) opened in 1880, so called because it was the first shaft in Wales large enough to allow two tramways. At the height of coal production, there were over 160 drift mines and over 30 shafts working the nine seams in the [[Blaenavon]] locality. [[Big Pit]] alone employed some 1300 men digging a quarter of a million tons of coal a year. Large amounts of coal were needed to supply the local [[ironworks]], as it took 3 tons of coal to produce a ton of iron. Blaenafon 'steam' coal was of high quality and it was exported globally. Burning hotly while leaving minimum ash, it was ideal to power the steam engines that drove ships and railways across the world.		However both [[economics]] and [[politics]] after [[World War I]] with its resultant [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]], the [[1930s]] [[Depression]] and later [[Nationalisation]] and the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]] took their toll and all the smaller pits were either abandoned or swallowed into Big Pit's encroaching search for new seams. Finally in February [[1980]] the [[coal]] ran out and even Big Pit, then the oldest mine in [[Wales]], had to close.		There are still nine headstocks remaining in Wales, including Big Pit (the metal frame erected in [[1921]] during the Miners' Strike of that year, to replace a wooden structure).

It is one of only two remaining mines where it is possible for visitors to journey to the underground workings some 300&nbsp;ft (90&nbsp;m) below using the same cages that transported the miners.		===Slate mining===	''See main article:  [[Slate industry in Wales]]''		North Wales also had a significant [[slate]] mining industry.		===Gold mining===		''See main article:  [[Welsh gold]]''		==Working mines==	Following the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]] the only deep mines still working in Wales, are [[Tower Colliery]], [[Hirwaun]], run by a miner's co-operative since 1994, which is facing closure in early 2008; and Aberpergwm, a smaller mine closed by the [[National Coal Board]] in 1985 but reopened in 1996. Several other small mines still exist, including the Blaentillery drift mine near to the [[Big Pit National Coal Museum]].		==List of mines in Wales==	*[[Clogau Gold Mine]]	*[[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]]	*[[Ffos-y-fran]]	*[[Gwynfynydd]]	*[[Nine Mile Point colliery]]	*[[Oakdale, Caerphilly|Oakdale]]	*[[Parys Mountain]]	*[[Sygun Copper Mine]]	*[[Tower Colliery]]	*[[Wyllie Colliery]]		== See also ==	*[[The Stars Look Down]]	*[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]	*[[Idris Davies]] the [[coal mining]] [[poet]] from [[Rhymney]]		==References==	{{reflist}}	* [http://www.norbiton.com/blaenavon/mining.htm Coal Mining in Blaenafon / Blaenavon, South Wales]		==External links==	* [http://www.aditnow.co.uk/ AditNow] -  Photographic database of mines	* [http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk Welsh Coal Mines] - all the Welsh pits and their brief histories	* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/index.shtml BBC Wales Coal House website]		[[Category:Mining in Wales|*]]	[[Category:Mining by country|Wales]]
