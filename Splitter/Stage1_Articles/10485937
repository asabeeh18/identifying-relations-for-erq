[[Image:Aquarium heater1.jpg|thumb|170px|A typical glass-tube immersion style aquarium heater]]	An '''aquarium heater''' is a device used in the [[Fishkeeping|fishkeeping]] hobby to warm the temperature of water in [[Aquarium|aquariums]].<ref name="baensch">{{cite book |last=Riehl |first=Rüdiger.

There are also heating mats that may be placed under the aquarium.<ref name=Sanford/>		==Glass immersion heaters== 	Most commonly, aquarium heaters are immersion style heaters, these heaters consist of a glass tube containing a [[heating element]] wound about a ceramic or glass insert. Some glass immersion heaters also contain [[sand]], and most, but not all, are fully [[submersible]].<ref name="baensch"/> The glass tube also contains an adjustable [[thermostat]] which turns the heating element on to maintain the required temperature.<ref name="baensch"/> This thermostat is often a bimetallic strip; because the strip contains two metals, the metals will expand at different rates when the temperature rises, causing the strip to bend. This strip carries the current, but breaks the current at the correct temperature. The setting of this bimetallic strip can be adjusted.<ref name=Sanford>{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | date = 1999 | pages = 169 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}</ref><ref name=axelrod>{{cite book | title = Exotic Tropical Fishes | last = Axelrod | first = Herbert, R. | publisher = T.F.H.

This has the added advantage of one heater being able to compensate in the event of one heater malfunctioning.<ref name=Sanford/>		==Undergravel heating==	Heating of the aquarium can also be achieved via a heating element in the form of a flexible heating cable that is buried beneath the [[substrate (aquarium)|aquarium substrate]].<ref name="baensch"/> Undergravel cable heating is popular in heavily planted aquariums.<ref>{{cite web | last = Uwe Behle | first = Dan Resler|title=Do-It-Yourself Substrate Heating Cables|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/Tech/Resler-Cables/| accessdate = 2007-04-05}}</ref>		==Undertank heating==	''Main Article: [[Undertank heater]]''		Aquaria can also be heated by the use of heating mats which are placed beneath aquaria.<ref name=Sanford/> Glass is, however, a poor conducter of heat and thus reduces the efficiency of this method of heating.<ref name="baensch"/>		==See also==	*[[Aquarium]]	*[[Fishkeeping]]		== References ==	<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------	 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a 	 discussion of different citation methods and how to generate 	 footnotes using the <ref>, </ref> and <reference /> tags	----------------------------------------------------------- -->	<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;">	<references /></div>		{{Aquarium}}	{{fishkeeping-stub}}		[[Category: Fishkeeping]]	[[Category:Heaters]]		[[no:Varmekolbe]]	[[pl:Grzałka akwarystyczna]]
