However, it was renamed "Huntsville" (after first settler John Hunt) during the [[War of 1812]], and has grown across nearby hills and along the [[Tennessee River]], adding [[textile]] mills, then [[munitions]] factories, to become a major city, hosting the [[NASA]] [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and [[Redstone Arsenal]].		Huntsville is the largest core city of the four-county large [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]].		__TOC__ <!--force Table of Contents after major facts -->	As of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the population of Huntsville was 164,570. As of 2006 Census estimates the Huntsville Metropolitan Area had a population of 368,661 with the city proper having 168,132 residents.<ref name=popest/> Huntsville, and its cross-river neighbor [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], combine their separate metro areas to form the [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], which, in 2004, had a total population of 510,088.		== History ==	===First settlers===	[[Image:BigSpring.jpg|thumb|right|The Big Spring, basis of street plan in Twickenham (renamed in 1812 to "Huntsville").]]	Huntsville is named after Revolutionary War veteran John Hunt, the first settler of the land around the [[Big Spring Park (Huntsville, Alabama)|Big Spring]]. However, Hunt did not properly register his claim, and the area was purchased by [[Leroy Pope]], who imposed the name Twickenham on the area to honor the home village of his distant kinsman [[Alexander Pope]].		Twickenham was carefully planned, with streets laid out on the northeast to southwest direction based on the Big Spring (''see images below''). However, due to anti-English sentiment during the War of 1812, the name was changed to Huntsville to honor John Hunt, who had been forced to move to other land south of the new city.		Both John Hunt and Leroy Pope were [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and charter members of [[Helion Lodge #1]].<ref name=helion>[http://www.helionlodge.org/ Helion Lodge #1, Huntsville, Alabama]</ref>		===Incorporation 1811===	In [[1811]], Huntsville became the first incorporated town in Alabama. However, the recognized "birth" year of the city is [[1805]], the year of John Hunt's arrival. The city's [[sesquicentennial]] anniversary was held in [[1955]] and the [[bicentennial]] was celebrated in [[2005]]. 		===Emerging industries===	Huntsville's quick growth was from wealth generated by the [[cotton]] and [[railroad]] industries. Many wealthy planters moved into the area from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In [[1819]], Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen's large cabinetmaking shop. The forty-four delegates meeting there wrote a constitution for the new state of [[Alabama]]. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama's first capital when the state was admitted to the [[United States of America|Union]]. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only, and the capital was then moved to another temporary location, [[Cahawba, Alabama|Cahawba]], until the legislature selected a permanent capital. (Today, the capital is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].)		===Civil War===	[[Image:Huntsville AL USA 1871 Birds Eye View.jpg|thumb|Bird's Eye View of 1871 Huntsville, Alabama.]]	In [[1855]], the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the Atlantic seacoast with the Mississippi River. Huntsville initially opposed secession from the Union in [[1861]], but provided many men for the state's defense when [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for an invasion of the South. The 4th Alabama Infantry Regiment, led by Col. Egbert J. Jones of Huntsville, distinguished itself at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Mannasas/Bull Run]], the first major encounter of the [[American Civil War]]. The Fourth Alabama Infantry, which contained two Huntsville companies, were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war and were present at the end when Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox]] in April [[1865]]. Eight generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville, evenly split with four on each side.		On the morning of [[April 11]], [[1862]], Union troops led by General [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] seized Huntsville to sever the Confederacy's rail communications. The Union troops were forced to retreat some months later, but returned to Huntsville in the fall of 1863 and thereafter used the city as a base of operations for the remainder of the war. While many homes and villages in the surrounding countryside were burned in retaliation for the active guerrilla warfare in the area, Huntsville itself was spared because it housed the occupying Union Army.		===After the Civil War===	[[Image:Child workers in Huntsville, Alabama.jpg|thumb|250px|[[child labor|Child workers]] at Merrimac Mills in Huntsville, November 1910. Photographed by [[Lewis Hine]].]]		After the Civil War, Huntsville became a center for cotton textile mills, such as Lincoln, Dallas and Merrimack. Each mill had its own housing community that included everything the mill workers needed (schools, churches, grocery stores, theatres, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill).		===Great Depression 1930s===	During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the [[Great Depression]]. Huntsville became known as the [[Watercress]] Capital of the World<ref name=MSFC>[http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html NASA MSFC Notes on the History of Huntsville]</ref> because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in [[cotton]] production during this time.<ref name=MSFC />		===World War II===	By [[1940]], Huntsville was still a small quiet town with a population of only 13,150 inhabitants. This quickly changed at the onset of [[World War II]], when Huntsville was chosen as the location of Redstone Arsenal, with its numerous munitions manufacturing plants. The Arsenal was almost closed in [[1949]] when it was no longer needed, but it saw new life when General H. N. Toftoy with support from Senator John Sparkman convinced the U. S. Army to choose Huntsville as the location for its missile research program. In [[1950]], General Toftoy brought German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]] and his colleagues to [[Redstone Arsenal]] to develop what would eventually become the United States' [[NASA|space program]].		===Space flight===	[[Image:Rockets in Huntsville Alabama.JPG|thumb|right|Historic rockets in [[Rocket Park]] of the [[United States Space & Rocket Center|US Space and Rocket Center]], Huntsville, Alabama.]]	On [[September 8]], [[1960]], U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] formally dedicated the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville. ([[NASA]] had already activated this facility, which is located on Redstone Arsenal, on [[July 1]] of that year.)		Huntsville is thus home to both [[Redstone Arsenal]] and the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], and is nicknamed "''The Rocket City''" for its close history with U.S. space missions. Huntsville has been important in developing space technology since the [[1950s]], when the German scientists headed by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]], brought to the [[United States]] at the end of [[World War II]] through [[Operation Paperclip]], arrived to develop rocketry for the U.S. Army. Their work included designing the [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone ballistic missile]], a variant of which, the [[Juno I]], carried the first U.S. satellite and astronauts into space. 		[[Image:SpaceShuttleAtSpaceCamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] at [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]]]]	The [[Saturn V]], utilized by the [[Apollo program]] manned Moon missions, was developed from the Redstone Arsenal. Huntsville continues to play an important role in the United States' [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]] programs. It is estimated that 1 in 13 of Huntsville's population are employed in some engineering field of work.		Huntsville's economy was nearly crippled and growth came to a near standstill in the 1970s following the closure of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]], but the emergence of the Space Shuttle and the ever-expanding field of [[missile defense]] in the 1980s helped give Huntsville a resurgence that continues to this day. The city continues to be the center of rocket-propulsion research in the United States, and is home to large branches of many [[defense contractor]]s.		Huntsville is also the location of the [[U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command]] (AMCOM). Huntsville's contributions to United States Cold War missile armament and technology earned it a "red star" designation as a target of the [[Soviet Union]] in the event of a nuclear exchange, fourth behind only [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}		==Geography==	Huntsville is located at 34°42' North, 86°35' West (34.7, -86.6){{GR|1}}.		According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 174.4&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (451.8&nbsp;[[km²]]), of which, 174.1&nbsp;square miles (450.8&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.4&nbsp;square miles (1.0&nbsp;km²) of it is water. The total area is 0.22% water.		Huntsville is located in the [[Tennessee River]] Valley. Several [[mesa]]s and large hills partially surround the city. These mesas are associated with the [[Cumberland Plateau]], and are locally called "mountains." [[Monte Sano]] (Italian for "Mountain of Health") is the most notable, and is east of the city along with Round Top (Burritt), Huntsville, and Green Mountains. Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin Mountains on [[Redstone Arsenal]] in the south. [[Brindlee Mountain]] is visible in the south across the Tennessee River.		As with other areas along the Cumberland Plateau, the land around Huntsville is [[karst]] in nature. Huntsville was founded around the Big Spring, which is a typical karst spring, and many [[cave]]s perforate the limestone bedrock underneath the city, as is common in karst areas. The headquarters of the [[National Speleological Society]] are located in Huntsville.		==Climate==	Huntsville has a [[humid subtropical climate]]. It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from 89.0 °F (31.6 C) in the summer to 49.0 °F (9.4 C) during winter. Some years, Huntsville experiences [[tornado]]es during the spring and fall. Significant tornado events include the [[Super Outbreak]] in 1974, the more recent [[November 1989 Tornado Outbreak]] in 1989 that killed 21 and injured almost 500, and the [[Anderson Hills Tornado]] that killed one and caused extensive damage in 1995. Since Huntsville is nearly 300 miles (480 km) inland, [[hurricane]]s are rarely experienced with their full force; however, many weakened tropical storms cross the area after a [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] landfall. While most winters have some measurable snow, significant snow is rare in Huntsville; but there have been some anomalies, like the 1963 New Years Day snowstorm, when 17 inches (43 cm) fell within 24 hours. Likewise, the [[Blizzard of 1993]] and a [[Groundhog Day]] snowstorm in [[1996]] were substantial winter events for Huntsville. However, as of the winter of 2005-06, Huntsville has gone 10 years without any significant snowfall (>4 inches).		{| class="wikitable"	! style="background: #DDDDDD; color: #000000" height="17" | Month	! style="background: #A0A0FF; color:#000000;" | Jan	! style="background: #A0A0FF; color:#000000;" | Feb	! style="background: #BBBBFF; color:#000000;" | Mar	! style="background: #CCCCDD; color:#000000;" | Apr	! style="background: #CCCCDD; color:#000000;" | May	! style="background: #E06655; color:#000000;" | Jun	! style="background: #EE5533; color:#000000;" | Jul	! style="background: #EE5533; color:#000000;" | Aug	! style="background: #CCCCDD; color:#000000;" | Sep	! style="background: #CCCCDD; color:#000000;" | Oct	! style="background: #BBBBFF; color:#000000;" | Nov	! style="background: #A0A0FF; color:#000000;" | Dec	! style="background: #DDDDDD; color:#000000;" | Year	|-	! style="background: #DDDDDD; color:#000080;" | Average high<br/>°F (°C)	| style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black;" | 49 (9)	| style="background: #FFFF99; color: black;" | 54 (12)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 63 (17)	| style="background: #FFCC00; color: black;" | 73 (23)	| style="background: #FF9900; color: black;" | 80 (27)	| style="background: #FF9900; color: black;" | 87 (31)	| style="background: #FF9900; color: black;" | 90 (32)	| style="background: #FF9900; color: black;" | 89 (32)	| style="background: #FF9900; color: black;" | 83 (28)	| style="background: #FFCC00; color: black;" | 73 (23)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 62 (17)	| style="background: #FFFF99; color: black;" | 52 (11)	| style="background: #FFCC00; color: black;" | 71 (22)	|-	! style="background: #DDDDDD; color:#000080;" height="16;" | Average low<br/>°F (°C)	| style="background: #F8F0F0; color: black;" | 30<br/>(-1)	| style="background: #F8F0F0; color: black;" | 33 (1)	| style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black;" | 41 (5)	| style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black;" | 49 (9)	| style="background: #FFFF99; color: black;" | 58 (14)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 65 (18)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 69 (21)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 68 (20)	| style="background: #FFCC66; color: black;" | 62 (17)	| style="background: #FFFF99; color: black;" | 50 (10)	| style="background: #FFFFCC; color: black;" | 40 (4)	| style="background: #F8F0F0; color: black;" | 33 (1)	| style="background: #FFFF99; color: black;" | 50 (10)	|-	! style="background: #DDDDDD; color:#000080;" | Average rainfall: inches/[[millimeter|mm]]	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 5 /<br/>127	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 5 /<br/>127	| style="background: #2288BB;" | 6.6<br/>168	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 4.8<br/>122	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 5.1<br/>130	| style="background: #66CCFF;" | 4.3<br/>109	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 4.6<br/>117	| style="background: #66CCFF;" | 3.5<br/>89	| style="background: #66CCFF;" | 4.1<br/>104	| style="background: #66CCFF;" | 3.3<br/>84	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 4.7 119	| style="background: #2288BB;" | 5.7 145	| style="background: #44AADD;" | 56.8 /<br/>1443	|}	<small>[http://www.Weatherbase.com source]</small>		==Demographics==	As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of [[2000]], there were 158,216 people living within the city limits.

Council elections are "staggered", meaning that Districts 1 and 5 will have elections simultaneously with mayoral elections in 2008, while Districts 2, 3, and 4 will have elections in August 2010.		There are also many boards and commissions run by the city, controlling everything from schools and planning to museums and downtown development.		''See also:'' [[List of mayors of Huntsville, Alabama]]		==Public Safety==	In 2007, Mayor Loretta Spencer combined the police, fire, and animal services departments to create the [http://www.hsvpolice.com/Department%20of%20Public%20Safety.htm Department of Public Safety]. The former chief of police, [http://www.hsvpolice.com/DPS%20Director_2.htm Rex Reynolds], was appointed as its director. The new department has nearly 900 employees and an annual budget of $63 million.		===Fire===	The [http://www.hsvcity.com/fire.php Huntsville Fire Department] has 18 engine companies and 4 ladder companies located in 17 stations throughout the city of Huntsville. Many Huntsville firefighters are also members of the regional Hazardous Materials and [http://www.alheavyrescue.com/ Heavy Rescue] response teams. The current chief is Danny Loggins.		===Police===	The [http://www.hsvcity.com/police Huntsville Police Department] has 3 precincts and 1 downtown HQ, 360 sworn officers, 150 civilian personnel, and patrols an area of 194.7 square miles (this number has grown due to recent annexations). The current chief is [http://www.hsvcity.com/police/chief2.htm Henry Reyes].		====Police Academy====	The [http://www.hsvcity.com/police/huntsvillepolice_academy.htm Huntsville Police Academy] is one of the oldest police academies in the United States. To date the Academy has completed 46 basic academies, and most recently the 47th Lateral Session. On [[May 8]], [[2006]] the Huntsville Police Academy began the 47th Basic Session. Until the 47th Lateral Session, academies were held at the Old Huntsville Airport on Airport Rd. After the gradation of the 46th Session, the academy moved to the Public Safety Training Complex on Sparkman Drive, which is also home to the Huntsville Fire Academy.		==Economy==	Huntsville's main economic influence is derived from aerospace and military technology. [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Cummings Research Park]] (CRP), and [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] comprise the main hubs for the area's technology-driven economy. CRP is the second largest research park in the United States and the fourth largest in the world, and is over 38 years old. Huntsville is also home for commercial technology companies such as the network access company [[ADTRAN]], computer graphics company [[Intergraph]] and design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure [[Avocent]]. Telecommunications provider [[Deltacom, Inc.]] and copper tube manufacturer and distributor [[Wolverine Tube]] are also based in Huntsville. [[Sanmina-SCI]] also has a large presence in the area.
