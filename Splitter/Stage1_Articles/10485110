[[390]]) was a [[France|French]] [[saint]] and [[bishop]]. He served as the sixth [[bishop of Langres]] from [[374]] until his death. [[Lodegaria|Saint Lodegaria]] was his sister.<ref>[http://www.forum-orthodoxe.com/avril0.php Forum Orthodoxe Francophone<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  		A legend states that he hid from his persecutors in a [[vineyard]].  The vine-dressers who concealed him converted to [[Christianity]].  Urban is thus the [[patron saint]] of all those who work in the [[Winemaking|wine industry]] and is invoked against [[blight]] and [[alcoholism]]. 		==Veneration==	The feast day and cult of St. Urban of Langres were closely associated with the [[weather]].  Several old German sayings reflect this:		:''Pankraz und Urban ohne Regen / bringen großen Erntesegen 	:''[The feast days of] [[Saint Pancras|Pancras]] and Urban without rain/ bring big rich harvests.''<ref>[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienU/Urban_von_Langres.html Urban von Langres - Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  		Pancras, one of the so-called [[Ice Saints]], was a saint closely associated with the weather.		:''Das Wetter auf St. Urban zeigt des Herbstes Wetter an.'' 	:''The weather on St. Urban's Day will indicate what the [[autumn]] weather will be like.''<ref>[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienU/Urban_von_Langres.html Urban von Langres - Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>		These are sayings that are similar to those said of the feast days of [[Swithun]], [[Medardus]], [[Godelieve]], and other "weather saints."  Another saying ties more closely to Urban’s particular patronage of wine growers:		:''Ist Sonnenschein am Urbanstag / gedeiht der Wein nach alter Sag''	:''If there is sunshine on St. Urban's Day/ the wine thrives afterwards, they say''		==Notes==	<references/>		==References==	*[http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0402.htm#urba Saints of April 2: Urban of Langres]	*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/SAINTS/saintu04.htm URBAN of Langres]	*{{de icon}} [http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienU/Urban_von_Langres.html Urban von Langres]	*{{de icon}} [http://www.heilbronn-neckar.de/Heilige/urban.htm Urban von Langres]		[[Category:French saints|Urban of Langres]]	[[Category:French bishops|Urban of Langres]]	[[Category:4th century bishops|Urban of Langres]]	[[Category:327 births|Urban of Langres]]	[[Category:390 deaths|Urban of Langres]]		[[de:Urban von Langres]]
