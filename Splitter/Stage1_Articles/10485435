The women's teams use the name '''Cowgirls'''. The University is a member of the [[Mountain West Conference]] and competes in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I]], fielding 15 [[varsity team]]s.  Wrestling is the only varsity sport that is not a member of the [[Mountain West Conference]].  It competes in the [[Western Wrestling Conference]].  The logo that adorns uniforms of the athletes is one of the most distinctive in the nation.  The football helmets were chosen as the third best logo helmet (no letters) by Sports Illustrated's 10 Spot.<ref name="Top10CollegeLogoHelmets">{{Cite web | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/writers/pete_mcentegart/11/19/ten.spot/index.html | title=The 10 Spot: Nov. 19, 2004 | publisher=''[[sportsillustrated.cnn.com]]''}}</ref>  On [[October 12]], [[2006]] [[Tom Burman]] was named the University's athletic director.		== History ==	=== Nickname ===	The nickname Cowboys was used as early as 1891 when a true [[cowboy]] assisted the Wyoming football team against a team from [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].  One of the Cheyenne players allegedly yelled "Hey, look at that cowboy," and the name stuck.<ref name="Cowobys">{{Cite web | url=http://wyomingathletics.cstv.com/trads/cowboys.html | title=Cowboys | publisher=''[[wyomingathletics.com]]''}}</ref>		=== Mascots ===	Wyoming is somewhat unique in that there are two mascots for the school - "Cowboy Joe" (a pony present primarily at football games) and "Pistol Pete" (a cowboy). The athletic teams are cheered on by the school song "[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe#University of Wyoming Fight Song|Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]" and the fight song "Fight, Wyoming, Fight". Men's athletic teams are known as "Cowboys" and women's teams are called "Cowgirls". Teams of either gender are also referred to as "Pokes", short for Cowpokes.		=== Football ===	Football began in 1893 at UW, and games were played against local high schools and [[Front Range]] colleges.  War Memorial Stadium was built in 1950 with an original capacity of 20,000 fans.<ref name="WarMemorialStadium">{{Cite web | url=http://wyomingathletics.cstv.com/facilities/warmemorial.html | title=Jonah Field at War Memorial Stadium | publisher=''[[wyomingathletics.com]]''}}</ref>  The stadium sits at 7,200 feet above [[sea level]], and is the highest [[Division I]] football stadium in the [[United States]].  Currently the "War" holds 32,580 rowdy fans.  The Wyoming Cowboys have two teams that are considered rivals.  Wyoming and [[Colorado State Rams|Colorado State]] meet annually in the [[Border War (Colorado State vs. Wyoming)|Border War]]; the winner receives the [[Bronze Boot]] trophy.  Wyoming leads the series 20-19.  [[Brigham Young University]] is also considered a rival.  Fans in western Wyoming tend to believe that BYU is the biggest rival, while fans in the rest of the state believe it is CSU.  In [[2004]], the Cowboy football team ended a 38-year bowl game victory drought by defeating the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Las Vegas Bowl]] on [[December 23]], [[2004]].		=== Men's Basketball ===	{{main|Wyoming Cowboys basketball}}	Wyoming's Men's Basketball team has also had its share of success.  In 1943 it defeated [[Georgetown University]] 46-34 to win the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]].		=== Women's Basketball ===	The Women's Basketball team hosted and won the 2006-2007 [[Women's National Invitation Tournament|WNIT]] (Women's National Invitation Tournament) after not receiving a bid in the 2006-2007 NCAA Tournament. The Cowgirls finished with a 27-9 overall record and 11-5 in the Mountain West Conference. They also finished second among Division I institutions with one of the largest increases from the previous season. They averaged 1,699 during the 2005-06 season compared to 4,638 during the 2006-07 Season. They also finshed 22nd among NCAA Attendance leaders, averaging 8,757 fans a game.		=== Cross Country ===	The Cowboy Men's and Women's Cross Country teams have had notable success over the years.  In 2001 the team tragically lost 8 runners in an accident involving another Wyoming student [[Clinton Haskins]].  Haskins was drunk at the time and is serving 14 - 20 years for his crime.<ref name="HaskinsDrunk">{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/03/earlyshow/contributors/tracysmith/main671470.shtml | title=Killer Drunk Driver Tries To Atone | publisher=''[[CBS]]''}}</ref>		=== Olympic Sports ===	University of Wyoming athletics has also been represented on the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] stage by swim sensation [[Scott Usher]].

The team competes in Division I and are a member of the [[Eastern Rockies Rugby Football Union]] (ERRFU) along with [[Colorado State University|Colorado State]], [[University of Colorado at Boulder|Colorado]], and [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]].  While UW rugby is a club sport, it competes against scholarship teams such as [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]].  The team regularly makes it the national tournament.  In 2000, they were runner-ups to the [[University of California at Berkeley]].  In [[1991]] and [[2002]], they placed fourth in the nation.<ref name="RugbyChampionships">{{Cite web | url=http://calbears.cstv.com/sports/m-rugby/archive/cal-m-rygby-champs.html | title=National Collegiate Rugby Championships | publisher=''[[calbears.cstv.com]]''}}</ref>	===== Women's Rugby =====	There is also a [[Women's rugby]] team at the [[University of Wyoming]] known as Wyoming Women's Rugby Football Union (WWRFU) which started in 1985.  They are a club sport but like the men, compete at a Division 1 level.  As a member of the [[Eastern Rockies Rugby Football Union]](ERRFU) they play teams like [[Colorado State University]], [[Airforce]], and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].  Another recently added team to ERRFU is the [[University of New Mexico]].  Though the women's team has far less numbers than the men's team, they continue to grow making it to their first regional tournament in 2007 where they finished in third place in the union and forth place in the [[West Rugby]] conference.

[http://wmedia.uwyo.edu/marchingband/cowboyjoe.mp3 Ragtime Cowboy Joe MP3].  In football, the fight song is sung throughout the game including when the team runs on the field, at kickoff, and after a touchdown.  A cannon in the north end zone fires every time a point is scored.  When the football teams runs from the RAC locker room to Jonah Field, they touch the Steamboat bronze statue for good luck.  The beer song is a long-standing tradition with the students.  The students will occasionally chant "Beer Song, Beer Song" until the band plays it.

The playing field is at an elevation of 7,220 feet (2200m), the highest in Division I football.  The natural grass field was replaced by artificial turf in [[2005 in sports|2005]].  The new surface, known as Desso Challenge Pro 60 Monofilament Synthetic Turf, is the first of its kind in Division I. 		Near the north end zone is a [[bronze]] statue depicting the Steamboat and rider logo.  At the beginning of the game and at halftime, the team runs from the locker room in the RAC to the field and the statue is touched as a token of good luck.		=== Arena-Auditorium ===	{{main|Arena-Auditorium}}	The Wyoming basketball teams have always enjoyed playing on the "Highest Courts" in the nation. Built in 1982 at a cost of $15 million, the [[Arena-Auditorium]] commonly called the '''A-A''' (or "Dome of Doom") seats over 15,000.  In the yard outside the A-A, is a beautiful statue named "Fanning a Twister."  This statue is a cowboy on top of bucking bronco, similar to the sports logo.	[[Image:UW FanningTwister.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Fanning a Twister Statue with War Memorial Stadium, Rochelle Athletics Center and the Arena Auditorium in the Background]]		=== UniWyo Sports Complex ===	The UniWyo Sports Complex serves as the facility for Cowboys Wrestling and Cowgirls Volleyball.  The seating capacity is approximately 1,200 people.  It is situated north of the Field House, south of the Arena-Auditorium, and northwest of War Memorial Stadium.  Formerly the Multi-purpose Gymnasium, it was renamed in 2005 to the UniWyo Sports Complex thanks in part to a $1 million gift.		=== Rochelle Athletics Center ===	Commonly called the '''RAC''' (pronounced "Rack"), it opened its doors on [[August 31]], [[2001]].  It serves as the training facility for all varsity sports.  It also contains the football locker room, an academic and counseling center, and a sports medicine facility.  It began construction May of 2000, and was competed at a cost of $9.4 million.<ref name="UWRAC">{{Cite web | url=http://wyomingathletics.cstv.com/genrel/rac.html | title=Building Wyoming's Athletic Legacy into the 21st Century, The Rochelle Athletics Center | publisher=''[[www.wyomingathletics.com]]''}}</ref>		=== Indoor Practice Facility ===	Construction on the new Indoor Practice Facility (also called the IPF) began in Fall of 2006.  It is located on the north portion of the War Memorial Stadium parking lot, north east of the stadium.  It is 82 feet high, and has a total of 85,000 square feet.  Due to the potential for inclement weather in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], it will be a highly useful tool in recruiting and protection from the elements.  When completed it will incorporate a plaza area between the RAC and lobby of the IPF that will be beautifully landscaped.  It is expected to be completed by the end of 2007 at a total cost of $11 million.		=== Glenn "Red" Jacoby Golf Club ===	===Future Facilities and Improvements===	Currently the athletic department has several projects regarding athletics facilities on its platter.  Continual improvements to War Memorial Stadium are being planned.  The addition of luxury boxes are in the planning stages, as well as a [[facade]] on the east side of the stadium.  Paving the parking lot is also planed for the near future.  Indoor tennis facilities are also on the agenda.  In a recent interview, Tom Burman also mentioned that he would like the Arena-Auditorium to be state of the art, and would like to add luxury suites.		== See also ==	*[[University of Wyoming]]	*[[Bronze Boot]]		== External links ==	*[http://www.wyomingathletics.com Official University of Wyoming Athletics Site]	*[http://wyoming.rivals.com Rivals Wyoming Sports Message Board]	*[http://www.wyonation.com Wyoming Athletics and Message Board]		== References ==	{{reflist}}	{{Mountain West Conference}}	{{Wyoming}}		[[Category:University of Wyoming]]	[[Category:College athletic programs]]		[[es:Wyoming Cowboys]]	[[fr:Wyoming Cowboys]]
