== Summary ==	A showing the decay of downtown Parkton, North Carolina. This town like many others in Eastern North Carolina is a shadow of its former self. Reasons for the decay, the loss of textile mill jobs and dramatic downturn in tobacco farming. Photo was taken by my wife.	== Licensing ==	{{GFDL-self}}
