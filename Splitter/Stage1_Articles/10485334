It was released in 1967 and is the first track on the album of the same name. According to a review at [[All Music Guide]] by Tom Maginnis, the song seems to find lead singer [[Jim Morrison]] "pondering the state of the then emerging hippie youth culture and how they are perceived by mainstream or 'straight' society."A visit to New York City by The Doors inspired Jim Morrison to write "Strange Days" and other songs on the [[Strange Days]] album.			According to [[No One Here Gets Out Alive]], "Strange Days" finds [[Ray Manzarek]] recording "one of the earliest examples of the [[Moog synthesizer]] in rock." The synth was hooked up with the help of [[Paul Beaver]].		Two music videos were made for the song. The first featured footage of the band backstage and onstage, as well as Jim Morrison driving his car into a hole in sand and jumping on the hood in frustration. The ending is considered by some to be quite violent. The second features the same circus performers on the Strange Days cover photo, who would explore New York City. It also included footage of various people, which was made "swervy" and distorted to fit in with the strange theme of the song. All of this new footage was mixed with footage of the old video, and re-released as a re-mixed video.		{{1960s-song-stub}}	{{The Doors}}	[[Category:The Doors songs]]
