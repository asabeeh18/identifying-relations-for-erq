'''Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)''' is a proposed mapping of [[Fibre Channel]] over selected full duplex [[IEEE 802.3]] networks. This would allow Fibre Channel to leverage the Technology of 10 Gigabit Ethernet while preserving the main parts of the Fibre Channel protocol. The specification is supported by a large number of network and storage vendors, including [[Broadcom]], [[Brocade]], [[Cisco]], [[EMC]], [[Emulex]], [[Finisar]],  [[HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Mellanox]], [[Netapp]], [[Nuova]], [[Qlogic]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].		== Functionality ==		FCoE replaces the lowest, physical, layer of the Fibre Channel stack by Ethernet. This allows a seamless integration in existing Fibre Channel networks and management software. A FCoE Converged Network Adapter (CNA) appears as a Fibre Channel Card to the server and as an Ethernet Card to the network.	The goal is to provide IO consolidation over a single network (Ethernet) reducing network complexity in the Data Center.		== Application ==		FCoE is particularly useful for Blade server and server virtualization, as it is often hard to include the required number of Fibre Channel and Ethernet adapters. With FCoE, network and storage data traffic is consolidated on one host interface.	Be aware that FCoE is not routable (in difference to [[iSCSI]]).		== Frame Format ==		FCoE is encapsulated over Ethernet with the use of a dedicated Ethertype. A single 4-bit field (version) satisfies the IEEE sub-type requirements. SOF and EOF are encoded as specified in RFC 3643. Reserved bits are present to guarantee that the FCoE frame meets the minimum length requirement of Ethernet. 		The FIP (FCoE Initialization Protocol) is also currently being defined.		<gallery>	Image:Ff.jpg|FCoE Frame Format	Image:fcoe-mod1.jpg|FCoE Model VE/VF ports	Image:fcoe-mod2.jpg|FCoE Model VN Ports	</gallery>		== FCoE Model ==		An FCoE model has been defined that includes  VF (Virtual F), VE (Virtual E) and VN (Virtual N) ports and and FCoE controller module.			== Timeline ==		The project has been proposed in the [http://www.t11.org/index.htm T11 standard body].	of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in April 2007 and a draft of the standard is expected in June 2008.		== See also ==	* [[HyperSCSI]]	* [[iSCSI]]	* [[ATA over Ethernet|ATA-over-Ethernet]] (AoE)		== External links ==		The project's hompage is [http://www.t11.org/fcoe http://www.t11.org/fcoe].
